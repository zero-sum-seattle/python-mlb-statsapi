## Getting Started

*Python-mlb-statsapi* is a Python library that provides developers with access to the MLB Stats API which allows developers to retrieve information related to MLB teams, players, stats, and more. *Python-mlb-statsapi* written in python 3.10+.

To get started with the library, refer to the information provided in this README. For a more detailed explanation, check out the documentation and the Wiki section. The Wiki contains information on return objects, endpoint structure, usage examples, and more. It is a valuable resource for getting started, working with the library, and finding the information you need.

## Examples

Let's show some examples of getting stat objects from the API. What is baseball with out stats right?

### MLB Stats

#### Player Stats
Get the Id(s) of the players you want stats for and set stat types and groups.
```python
>>> mlb = mlbstatsapi.Mlb()
>>> player_id = mlb.get_people_id("Ty France")[0]
>>> stats = ['season', 'career']
>>> groups = ['hitting', 'pitching']
```
Use player.id and stat types and groups to return a stats dictionary
```python
>>> stat_dict = mlb.get_player_stats(player_id, stats=stats, groups=groups )
>>> season_hitting_stat = stat_dict['hitting']['season']
>>> career_pitching_stat = stat_dict['pitching']['career']
```
Print season hitting stats
```python
>>> for split in season_hitting_stat.splits:
...     for k, v in split.stat.__dict__.items():
...             print(k, v)
gamesplayed 140
groundouts 163
airouts 148
runs 65
doubles 27
triples 1
homeruns 20
strikeouts 94
baseonballs 35
...
>>> for split in career_pitching_stat.splits:
...     for k, v in split.stat.__dict__.items():
...             print(k, v)
gamesplayed 2
gamesstarted 0
groundouts 2
airouts 4
runs 1
doubles 0
triples 0
homeruns 1
strikeouts 0
baseonballs 0
intentionalwalks 0

...

```
#### Team stats
Get the Team Id(s)
```python
python3
>>> mlb = mlbstatsapi.Mlb()
>>> team_id = mlb.get_team_id('Seattle Mariners')[0]
```
Set the stat types and groups.
```python
>>> stats = ['season', 'seasonAdvanced']
>>> groups = ['hitting']
```
Use team.id and the stat types and groups to return season hitting stats
```python
stats = mlb.get_team_stats(team_id, stats=stats, groups=groups)
season_hitting = stats['hitting']['season']
advanced_hitting = stats['hitting']['seasonadvanced']
```
Print season and seasonadvanced stats
```python
>>> for split in season_hitting.splits:
...     for k, v in split.stat.__dict__.items():
...         print(k, v)
gamesplayed 162
groundouts 1273
airouts 1523
runs 690

```
### More stats examples
#### Expected Stats
Get player Id's
```python
>>> player_id = mlb.get_people_id('Ty France')[0]
```
Set the stat type and group
```python
>>> stats = ['expectedStatistics']
>>> group = ['hitting']
```
Get Stats
```python
>>> stats = mlb.get_player_stats(player_id, stats=stats, groups=group)
>>> expectedstats = stats['hitting']['expectedstatistics']
>>> for split in expectedstats.splits:
...     for k, v in split.stat.__dict__.items():
...         print(k, v)
avg .259
slg .394
woba .317
wobacon .338
```
#### vsPlayer
Get pitcher and batter player Ids
```python
>>> ty_france_id = mlb.get_people_id('Ty France')[0]
>>> shohei_ohtani_id = mlb.get_people_id('Shohei Ohtani')[0]
```
Set stat type, stat groups, and params
```python
>>> stats = ['vsPlayer']
>>> group = ['hitting']
>>> params = {'opposingPlayerId': shohei_ohtani_id}
```
Get stats
```python
>>> stats = mlb.get_player_stats(ty_france_id, stats=self.stats, groups=self.group, **self.params)
>>> vs_player_total = stats['hitting']['vsplayertotal']
>>> for split in vs_player_total.splits:
...     for k, v in split.stat.__dict__.items():
...             print(k, v)
gamesplayed 4
groundouts 3
airouts 4
runs None
doubles 1
triples 0
homeruns 0
...
>>> vs_player = stats['hitting']['vsplayer']
>>> for split in vs_player.splits:
...     for k, v in split.stat.__dict__.items():
...             print(k, v)
gamesplayed 2
groundouts 1
airouts 2
runs None
doubles 1
triples 0
homeruns 0
```
#### hotColdZones
Get player Id's
```python
>>> ty_france_id = mlb.get_people_id('Ty France')[0]
>>> shohei_ohtani_id = mlb.get_people_id('Shohei Ohtani')[0]
```
Set the stat types and groups
```python
>>> stats = ['hotColdZones']
>>> hitting_group = ['hitting']
>>> pitching_group = ['pitching']
```
The stat groups pitching and hitting both return hotColdZones for a pitcher and hitter. hotColdZones are not assigned to a
stat group because of issues related to the REST API. So hotColdZones will be assigned to the stat key in stats return dict.
```python
>>> hitting_hotcoldzones = mlb.get_player_stats(ty_france_id stats=type, groups=hitting_group)
>>> pitching_hotcoldzones = mlb.get_player_stats(shohei_ohtani_id, stats=type, groups=pitching_group)
```
hotColdZones returns a list of the HotColdZones
```python
>>> ty_france_hotcoldzones = hitting_hotcoldzones['stats']['hotcoldzones']
>>> shohei_ohtani_hotcoldzones = pitching_hotcoldzones['stats']['hotcoldzones']
```
Loop through hotColdZone objects for Ty France
```python
>>> for split in ty_france_hotcoldzones.splits:
...     print(split.stat.name)
...
onBasePercentage
onBasePlusSlugging
sluggingPercentage
exitVelocity
battingAverage
```
Loop through hotColdZone objects for Shoei Ohtani
```python
>>> for split in shohei_ohtani_hotcoldzones.splits:
...     print(split.stat.name)
...
onBasePercentage
onBasePlusSlugging
sluggingPercentage
exitVelocity
battingAverage
```
Print zone information for obp
```python
>>> for split in ty_france_hotcoldzones.splits:
...     if split.stat.name == 'onBasePercentage':
...             for zone in split.stat.zones:
...                 print('zone: ', zone.zone)
...                 print('value: ', zone.value)
zone:  01
value:  .226
zone:  02
value:  .400
zone:  03
value:  .375
zone:  04
```
#### Passing params
Get Team Ids
```python
python3
>>> mlb = mlbstatsapi.Mlb()
>>> team_id = mlb.get_team_id('Seattle Mariners')[0]
```
Set the stat types and groups.
```python
>>> stats = ['season', 'seasonAdvanced']
>>> groups = ['hitting']
```
Pass season to get_team_stats()
```python
stats = mlb.get_team_stats(team_id, stats=stats, groups=groups, season=2018)
season_hitting = stats['hitting']['season']
advanced_hitting = stats['hitting']['seasonadvanced']
```
season should be 2018
